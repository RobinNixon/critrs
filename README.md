CRITRS: Causal Relationship Information Theory Realtime Simulator

"So," you may be asking, "what's all this then, just another version of *John Conway's Life?". An understandable question, but the answer is no, it's actually something quite different and new, and also sort of yes, in that it's all about ones and zeros in a binary 2D world, so it may remind you of the original Life program from 1970.

The main thing about CRITRS is that, unlike the Game of Life, there is no birth or death, and therefore the total number of filled locations always remains the same, unless you add or remove any using the mouse or buttons provided. Instead, movement and change occur by swapping the contents of locations according to sets of rules.

To get started with this program, perhaps you may wish to click the [Apply Next Preset] button (or press 'A') now and then, and watch the results of simply writing the word 'Critrs' into the world's empty locations. Note that the presets load into the current zoom level, so you will see different results depending on how far you are zoomed in or out. You will soon see many types of gliders and flyers.

You can also play several variations of the Game of Life in CRITRS (and in color too!) by pressing the button in the panel. After a while you will notice how many configurations wind up with a stable pattern, and others even result in total wipeout. With carefully placed initial cells, however, you can achieve quite interesting results.

The entire program is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript so will run on almost any device, except those with small screens and no keyboards or mice :)

If you create anything with this or develop it further, please accredit my work when you do so, thanks! And feel free to brainstorm with me at robin@robinnixon.com.

* Please note that CRITRS is not to be confused with 'Critters' by Tommaso Toffoli and Norman Margolus. The similarity of name is unfortunate, but I was unaware of their work when I started my own research in 2013.
